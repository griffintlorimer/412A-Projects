# 412A-Projects
These are the projects I worked on for 412A Artificial Intelligence at Washington University in St. Louis during the Fall of 2021.   These projects are based off projects from the CS188 course at UC Berkeley.

Wrote search algorithms including Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A* Search to help Pac-Man locate dot(s).  Also wrote several different heuristics to help locate the closest dot.
