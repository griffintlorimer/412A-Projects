# 412A-Projects
These are the projects I worked on for 412A Artificial Intelligence at Washington University in St. Louis during the Fall of 2021.   These projects are based off projects from the CS188 course at UC Berkeley.

## [Project 1: Search in Pacman ](https://github.com/griffintlorimer/412A-Projects/tree/main/project1)
Implemented search algorithms including Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A* Search to help Pac-Man locate dot(s).  Also wrote several different heuristics to help locate the closest dot.  
Autograder score: 19/20

## [Project 2: Multi-Agent Pacman](https://github.com/griffintlorimer/412A-Projects/tree/main/project2)
Created a reflex agent based on sereral different parameters.  Initially created the Pac-Man reflex agent based on the minimax algorithm then improved its performance by implementing alpha-beta pruning. Used expectimax search algorithm for ghost reflex agents. Also wrote an evaluation function for Pac-Man.
Autograder score: 20/20

## [Project 3: Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/griffintlorimer/412A-Projects/tree/main/project3)
Created several different agents using value iteration, Q-learning, and an Epsilon Greedy approach.
